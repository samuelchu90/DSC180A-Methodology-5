Q and A: <br>
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
I think the two most interesting things we covered this quarter were deep learning models and antimicrobial peptides(AMPs). We got to learn more about how deep learning models work and their extreme effectiveness in certain situations. We read some papers that use these deep learning models to help with the development of new antibiotics. This is done through the identification of new AMPs.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
Something that our mentor, Rob Knight, brought up before was to try to find new antimicrobial peptides in data outside of the human microbiome. The paper we are replicating in Quarter 1 is only looking at human microbiome data to identify new AMPs, but I think it would be interesting to look for AMPs in other microbiome datasets. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br>
We are still working on replicating our Quarter 1 Project, so we will have to see our results to gauge if we want to change our model or not. The research paper we are replicating though has already tested a lot of different ensembles of LLMs and LSTMs and have reported on which ones performed the best. Most likely, we will follow their recommendations.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** <br>
Since in our Quarter 1 project we are planning on reusing the model weights given to us the research paper, I would be interested in pre-training our own model for our second quarter project. 

Reflection on Q1 Project: I think we are a little behind schedule, but we will try to make up ground this week.
